# hyper-wal

Extension for using colorschemes generated by wal in [Hyper](https://hyper.is).

## How to use

* Get [wal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/wal)
* Generate a colorscheme based on a wallpaper
* Install [Hyper](https://hyper.is) and add `hyper-wal`
to `plugins` in `~/.hyper.js`.

## How it works

The plugin will look for a plain text file at `~/.cache/wal/colors` which should
have been generated by wal.
